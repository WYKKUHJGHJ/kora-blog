Bitcoin just did it again — smashed through the $100,000 mark like it was nothing, hitting a high of $104K today. Yep, the bull is back and it’s charging hard. A mix of strong technicals, macro optimism, and good old FOMO is clearly in the driver’s seat.

Tech Talk:
Charts are looking hot — RSI is flying above 70, signaling a bit of overbought pressure. Still, the uptrend stays intact. The 50-day moving average is climbing steadily, showing that the momentum is very much alive.

Mood Check:
Fear & Greed Index? Sitting deep in “Greed” territory. Investors are clearly leaning bullish. Bitcoin ETFs saw a surge in volume — looks like big money is making moves, and retail isn’t far behind either.

Quick Tips:
	•	For short-term traders: Keep an eye on $100K as your line in the sand. If it cracks, expect some pullback.
	•	Long-term holders: Sit tight and smile. Just don’t FOMO in — be patient and average in if we get dips.

TL;DR:
Bitcoin’s on a rocket again. The only question now — are you strapped in or just watching from the launchpad?
